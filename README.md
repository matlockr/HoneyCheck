<h1 align="center">About</h1>

Honeycheck is an iOS mobile application that was designed as a tool for beekeepers to allow for them to monitor and store information about their hives and the honey calculations within. The honey calculation is used doing image analysis on a personally taken picture of a bee hive frame. These pictures can be taken in the moment of needed calculation or can be loaded later from the device's photo library. 

There are two methods of image analysis the user can select from. There is the drawing feature mode and the default method of using a trained data model.

- Trained data model
  -  Using a trained model to detect where honey is classified on a honeycomb frame and the measurements of how much honey is contained on average within a given cell\. Example pictures may be added at a later date\. 
  -  This method also involves a cropping tool where the user will be expected to rotate and crop the image down to the honeycomb frame where the actual comb begins. 
  -  This method of measurement allows for a more seamless user experience.
- Drawing method
  - This method allows for the user to take the picture of the frame as usual, but then expects them to use a drawing tool to fill in the area where they know honey is contained.
  - This method could be useful if the trained data model seems to be having errors, or when the honeycomb is too complex for the data model to determine what is honey and what is not. 

All data used to make measurements was collected in tandem with our original client, Jefferson State Apiaries. The current data measurements would need to be adjusted by developers if corrections must be made, and therefore the numbers that you get are a close estimation rather than a guarantee to the amounts of honey within your hive. 

This tool was not developed with the intention of determining how much honey you will harvest from a hive, but rather the make sure that the hive is healthy enough going into the winter. We once again cannot guarantee the hive health or survival, this is merely a tool meant to help beekeepers with their measurements when possible.

<h1 align="center">How to Use</h1>

To use the HoneyCheck application the user needs to follow a simple set of steps(Screenshots to be added at a later date): 

1. Load into the application, the user will see a landing page with a hive selection button, a plus sign in the top right and a setting cog.
2. Select the + symbol in the top right to begin a new hive
3. To enter a hive and add boxes: Select a saved hive name from the name boxes. 
4. To save a hive: Enter a name for your hive. Press the + symbol to the right of the naming box to add the hive. 
5. If you wish to delete old hives there is an option for that here near each saved hive.
6. To enter a box, press the name of a saved box. To save a box, hit the + in the top right. Deletion functions the same as hives.
7. Frames follow the same conventions as boxes for functionality.
8. Select your template from either the defaults or create a custom template for your usage. These are the bee frame sizes, and are fairly standard.
9. After selecting your template, you will see a Side A picture prompt. Press the camera logo. You may use an image from your image library or take one in the moment. 
10. You will want to crop this image usually to cleanly get the image cropped along the frame. 
11. Repeat the process for side B picture after being analyzed.
12. See your new data on the front page of beehives! 

This is a basic breakdown of how to step through the app, but this is not the only pathway that can be taken to use the app.
